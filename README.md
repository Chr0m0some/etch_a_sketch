# etch_a_sketch
1. Make a 16 x 16 grid with JS that fits within a defined space and has a container to live in the HTML
2. Give the grid a background color
3. Add logic in JS that makes it so that when the user hovers over a grid square, that grid turns a certain color
4. Add two extra grid options that turn the grid size to 64 x 64 and 100 x 100; use buttons to change size and reload the grid
5. Add a clear button that reloads the grid upon press
6. Add a mode that turns a grid square a random color upon mousehover

# Issues and Concerns
1. Create borders within the grid lines?
2. Add enough spacing between title and main grid container and edges of window?
