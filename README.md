# etch_a_sketch
1. ~~Make a 16 x 16 grid with JS that fits within a defined space and has a container to live in the HTML~~
2. ~~Give the grid a background color~~
3. ~~Add logic in JS that makes it so that when the user hovers over a grid square, that grid turns a certain color~~
4. Add two extra grid options that turn the grid size to 64 x 64 and 100 x 100; use buttons to change size and reload the grid
5. ~~Add a clear button that reloads the grid upon press~~
6. Add a mode that turns a grid square a random color upon mousehover

# Nice to Have
1. Make a feature that has the rainbow button pick random colors as a background when its chosen and hovered over

# Issues and Concerns
1. Create borders within the grid lines?
